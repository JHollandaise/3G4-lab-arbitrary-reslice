Familiarisation with the visualisation software

Deducing the age of the patient:

Observations
1. Patient only has baby teeth
2. They have lost their 2 lower center incisors

Conclusions
1. Definately below the age of 9.
2. 2 lower center incisors are usually the first to go around age 5-7 so the patient is around this age. Probably about 6.

Reslicing

Visual differences:
w nearest neighbour it is pixely
with linear interpolation it gives a smoother image but rows and columns of pixels can still be roughly made out
with a higher order interpolater it is smoother still
